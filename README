Important Instructions

1. vmdist/install_vm.sh is the official set of dependencies and requirements. It installs everything on a default ubuntu 10.10, and should at least work reliably on a virtualbox machine (i.e. no nvidia drivers).

2. You need to run download.sh to get the dataset. Soon you'll be able to do it with blockplayer.dataset.download(), but right now that just prints out some instructions.

3. The setup.py isn't operational right now. But you need to run './build.sh' in blockplayer/ to build the ctype so.
