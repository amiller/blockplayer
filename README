Important Instructions

1. vmdist/install_vm.sh is the official set of dependencies and requirements. It installs everything on a default ubuntu 10.10, and should at least work reliably on a virtualbox machine (i.e. no nvidia drivers).

2. You need to run download.sh to get the dataset. Soon you'll be able to do it with blockplayer.dataset.download(), but right now that just prints out some instructions.

3. The setup.py isn't operational right now. But you need to run './build.sh' in blockplayer/ to build the ctypes so. 



If want to run the tests or makewww headless (the demos will probably be pointless), then you need to start an X virtual server with
    Xvfb
You might also need to specify the mesa rather than the nvidia drivers, if you have those installed. So, for shelling into my school desktop, I use the following:
    LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/mesa/libGL.so xvfb-run bash

and then I would run one of the scripts: 
    python makewww/make_calib.py
