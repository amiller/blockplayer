BlockPlayer - Virtual Machine Distribution
-----------

Follow these instructions to set up BlockPlayer in a virtual machine. This is the easiest way to test 


1. Make sure you have VirtualBox installed. You should get the Open Source Edition for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

2. Download the virtual disk image (.vdi)
<I need to create one first>

3. Run the virtual image. Headless or graphical?



Steps to set up the VM Image
------------
1. Install virtualbox
2. Download ubuntu-10.10-i386-desktop or something similar
3. Create a new virtualbox called 'blockplayer' using the GUI
4. Install ubuntu using default settings and an user account: 
   user/user
5. Install SSH so we can do the rest of the configuring in headless mode, then shutdown
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
6. Since this took a while, this is a good place to backup the .vdi


Installing the code and datasets
-----------
1. Start the vmware in headless mode
   VBoxHeadless -startvm blockplayer 
2. Run the install script provided here:
   setup_vmdist.sh
